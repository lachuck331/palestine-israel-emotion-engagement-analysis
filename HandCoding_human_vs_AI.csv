19,nekjfsw,IsraelPalestine,"The UN represents the countries of the world. And the countries of the world represent the population of those countries. So ultimately, the way the UN treats countries is similar to how people treat the people who live in those countries.

That's why the UN couldn't care less about millions dying in Africa, be it in massive wars that kill millions, or actual genocides and mass starvation, that's happening right now. That's why they mostly don't mind when Arabs are killing other Arabs, unless they can somehow tie the Jews to it (compare Yemen and Gaza, Damour and Sabra and Shatila, and so on). 

And yes, how they treat the Jewish state, is largely a reflection of how the world sees the Jews. With a strong portion (many of whom led by actual, Holocaust-denying antisemites, from countries where 80%-90% of the population have classically antisemitic views) arguing that the Jews are not just the worst evil in the world, but worse than all the other evils combined. And everyone else agreeing that even if that's not true, the Jews' existence, and ability to defend themselves, is not given, as with other countries, but conditional on the goodwill of their non-Jewish rulers.

With that said, I don't think just saying ""the UN is antisemitic"" will convince anyone. Not even pointing out that one of the people who wrote this report, literally said that the ""Jewish lobby"" is controlling social media. A statement mirrored by the UNHRC's other vehicle for anti-Israeli propaganda reports, internationally-recognized antisemite Francesca Albanese, when she said that the US is controlled by the Jewish lobby. Some people, ultimately, will never agree that anything can be antisemitic, including literal mass murder of Jews. Even view the label ""antisemitic"" as a badge of honor - a behavior that was used to be limited to Neo-Nazis, but now has spread to people who identify as non-racists. But it's much harder to argue that the UN is a ""Western based organization"", and there's anything notable about it lambasting the ""Western allied state"" of Israel. That's not some subjective judgement call, that can be dismissed by saying the Jews are lying about being targets of racism.

An admitted Jihadist terrorist group…”
You mean the group that was literally elected in 2006 and has governed under blockade and occupation ever since? Israel controls Gaza’s borders, airspace, and sea — but sure, let’s pretend it’s some random “neighboring country.”

“Sprayed bullets into the backs of hundreds of people from 27 countries…”
That line alone screams propaganda and honestly? Its very lazy of you. Even Israeli officials have walked back early claims and numbers once independent investigations started contradicting their “fog-of-war” storytelling. Maybe check beyond the IDF press releases before repeating them like gospel.

“They also took 251 hostages…”
Oh let’s stop the fake outrage and concern. 
Yes — and how many Palestinians are still held hostage by Israel without trial, including children? Israel has detained and tortured civilians for decades under “administrative detention,” but that somehow doesn’t count? Or is it just convenient not to mention it? 

“They launched thousands of rockets…”
Meanwhile Israel’s been flattening entire residential blocks, refugee camps, hospitals, cities, and schools — killing tens of thousands, most of whom were women and kids. If rockets are your measure of morality, you might want to weigh that against 2,000-lb bombs dropped daily. 😂 

“How do you not see this as an act of war?”
Because “war” implies two equal sides. Gaza is an occupied, besieged strip of land experiencing a genocide by the heavy hand of US-Israel military machine. What you’re describing is the consequence of decades of apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and state terror — not the start of a war, but a response within one.

Ultimately you’re just talking out of your behind with little to no stake or resolve in fully understanding this terrible situation so your response, opinions and insights are irrelevant with no value. Remember that please.

**Why**? Is there a reason why they would not want a Palestinian State?

Only [16% of Jewish Israelis](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/03/israeli-public-is-increasingly-skeptical-about-lasting-peace/) think that lasting peace is possible with a potential Palestinian State. Only [28% of the population feels safe](https://www.inss.org.il/publication/survey-june-2025/). 

[Half of Israelis](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/03/views-of-the-potential-for-lasting-peace/) do not think that a two-state solution is possible.

&gt;They openly call for annexing the West Bank and have dismissed Palestinian national identity as 'an invention.'

How much power do they actually hold?

&gt;Ben-Gvir himself is a disciple of hardline Kahanist ideology and is currently in charge of the the National Security Ministry, he’s advocated (and facilitated) arming settlers, encouraged police crackdowns on Arab citizens, and even suggested stripping disloyal Arab Israelis of citizenship.

Again, how much **political** power does he wield? Does he have the political means to achieve these ideals?

Gvir has a [54% unfavorable](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2025/06/03/views-of-israeli-and-palestinian-political-leaders/) rating.

&gt;While they are less openly militant, they do support coalition policies that entrench permanent control over the territories while extracting concessions on religion-state issues that erode secular Israeli's rights.

Once again, do they wield political power to achieve these goals?

&gt;they pushed judicial reforms aimed at weakening checks and balances inside Israel itself.

&gt;pushed for weakening Israel’s High Court, the same court that in theory provides some protection for minority rights.

**This** is what people should be protesting against. The problem is that Netanyahu and other right wing politicians keep getting elected because of the increase of terrorism that happened under left leaning governments. Only [1% of Israelis want Hamas](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/05/SR_25.05.09_gaza_1.png?resize=420,386) to stay in power after the war.

&gt;
&gt;Until the closure of the Rafah crossing on May 6, 2024, approximately 5,000 Gazans, sick and accompanied, had left for medical treatment in other countries. Since then, until early July 2024, several dozen people had left for medical treatment through the Kerem Shalom crossing. On July 1, 2024, the government committed to the Supreme Court to establish a mechanism that would allow Gazans to leave for medical treatment outside of Israel. On July 30, 2024, 148 patients and their companions left for medical treatment in the United Arab Emirates. On August 15, 2024, 26 Gazans were reported to have left for medical treatment in Jordan. In early November 2024, 231 Gazans were flown to the United Arab Emirates and Romania for medical treatment.

Palestinians never remember their violence against Jews October 7 or for 70 years since 1948. They also never remember the reason they were moved out of Israel. 

In 1948, Arab governments refused to let their people share the land with Jews. They said Islam could never be subservient to any other religion. Swedish diplomats invented the fake right of return to placate Arabs and Arab oil. 

Instead many Arab villages attacked Israeli settlements they had lived peacefully with for  decades. Islamic clerics also insisted Palestinians attack Jews and leave Israel. Israel’s army didn’t have enough troops to garrison all the villages that attacked them.  Israel did force 500k-600k Arab civilians to leave. 200,000 who didn’t attack Jews stayed.  

The UN through UNRWA have sustained a fake right of return for 70 years that NO OTHER REFUGEES were given. Did Muslims in Pakistan have rights in India after independence? No. 

If Palestinians hadn’t promised to wipe Israel off the map since 1948, Israel might have let them return. No country would let their own murderers back in. 

The UNHCR is a separate refugee organization that tries to integrate all other refugees into countries that accept them. UNHCR fostered peaceful resettlements all over the world that typically took less than 5-10 years to achieve success.

Please read it: [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dgqn7nq0no](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dgqn7nq0no) and please note that the BBC is frequently criticized for their anti-Israel news coverage and breached their own editorial standards to do so [https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/bbcs-israel-hamas-coverage-breached-editorial-guidelines-asserson-report-1236137850/](https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/bbcs-israel-hamas-coverage-breached-editorial-guidelines-asserson-report-1236137850/)

  
When you read the BBC article, did you notice how they mentioned affluent neighborhoods in Gaza?

The narrative has long been that Gaza was a concentration camp. An open air prison. Yet they have affluent neighborhoods. Concentration camps did not have luxury accommodations for the wealthy. Neither do prisons. 

So I think the destruction of Gaza should be reported through the stories of Gazans who lived through the destruction. Let them report what they lost. 

I feel this for two reasons:

1) Reports from Gazan citizens will give a clearer picture of how their lives changed since the war, which will yield a much more accurate account of what Gaza was like before the war. Let Gazans report on how their 10 room apartment was destroyed. How they no longer have access to swimming pools and tennis courts. Because they did lose these things. However, concentration camps and prisons typically don't offer spacious living arrangements and swimming lessons. Let the lie of Gaza being a concentration camp or a prison die.

2) There are affluent neighborhoods in Gaza largely because Hamas compensates itself handsomely from funds that are supposed to provide for the people of Gaza. Let the Hamas members and their associates identify themselves to the world.",trust,politics,neutral,"politics,humanitarian",anger,violence

95,nnl1m5e,IsraelPalestine,"The sense of self importance among my fellow Jews is astounding. His victory isn’t about Israel. He tries to barely even talk about Israel. He’s the mayor of NEW YORK CITY.

I get it, it’s a city with the biggest population of Jews outside of Israel so it’s a special place to us. My family immigrated to New York. All my Jewish half of the family is from New York.

But we CANNOT base our important domestic decisions on a complicated moral issue happening elsewhere. It’s not even that complicated. Don’t hold it against someone for being against violence and then also call him a terrorist. He doesn’t have to have fully formed opinions about Israel.

NYC is for all immigrants not just the Jewish ones. My Irish immigrant side also came to New York. What I keep telling my mom is, the lessons we’re supposed to learn from our people’s history isn’t that Jews are special. It’s that you have to treat everyone humanely. Every immigrant! Gay! Disabled! People of every ethnicity. People from anywhere. 

In the absence of being someone who makes decisions for Israel, he doesn’t need to explain why he has previously expressed that RELIGIOUS NATIONALISM IS BAD! Aren’t you all seeing it here? The evangelical Christians are the problem. We actually share in being a religious minority (in America) with Muslims and it’s something it seems younger people cherish and the more traditional older Jewish people I know usually fail entirely to see.

Edit to clarify my last paragraph: the evangelical Christian’s brand of nationalism is the problem in the USA at this time.",anger,"religion,politics",anger,"politics,religion",trust,religion
